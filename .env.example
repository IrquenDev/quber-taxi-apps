# Environment Variables Configuration
# 
# This project uses a multi-environment setup with the env/ directory.
# 
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 
# 1. Create the env/ directory in the root of the project (if it doesn't exist)
# 
# 2. Create env/.env file with the target environment:
#    targetEnvironment=dev
# 
#    Valid values: dev, prod, staging (or any other environment you configure)
# 
# 3. Create environment-specific files in env/ directory:
#    - env/.env.dev    (for development environment)
#    - env/.env.prod   (for production environment)
#    - env/.env.staging (for staging environment, if needed)
# 
#    Each file should contain the actual environment variables:
#    BASE_URL=https://api-dev.example.com
#    MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-mapbox-access-token
# 
# 4. To switch environments, only change the 'targetEnvironment' value in env/.env
# 
# EXAMPLE:
# 
# env/.env:
#   targetEnvironment=dev
# 
# env/.env.dev:
#   BASE_URL=http://qnecesitas.nat.cu/qubertaxiapi
#   MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-dev-mapbox-token
# 
# env/.env.prod:
#   BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
#   MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-prod-mapbox-token
# 
# NOTES:
# - All files in env/ directory are gitignored and should never be commited
# - Do NOT commit actual .env files with sensitive data (still gitignored) perform the migration and remove it.
# - This .env.example file documents the setup but is not used by the application
